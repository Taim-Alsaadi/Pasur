ISSUES:
  In Pasur, if you play a card that CAN capture something it MUST capture something 
    Need to check table for possibile capture based on cards BEFORE displaying push to table
  Score not working properly

Soon:
  Table cards all in one line gets too long, find way to next line every 4 cards
  Work on multiple rounds
  Way to cancel new game creation
  Put repeating code in functions
  show more game stats on end
  waiting for player event still not implemented in client

Testing:
  Test if sur activate affects getting surs

Later:
  Change from order 1 and 2 to boolean dealer? maybe
  Make one player the host?
  if you take too long on name prompt user disconnects????
  Change the name prompt to a custom one
  How to handle fail to connect?
  add global naming system (cookies)
  decide game winning score on game creation
  add burning effect to jack placed on bare table


Need to test:
  Enable SUR 5 point bonus 
  The player who captures the final card also captures the remaining cards on the table. 
  Remove jack from table if it was dealt there on starting deck


Maybe:
  ADD ABILITY FOR MORE THAN TWO PLAYERS



DONE:
  Leave card on table if nothing can be captured
  What if you add a card into play that can never proceed? Must add a safe way back
  Work on handing out new decks


Rules for this game (to be made into options)
  Winning is 63 points
  No sur after 50 points
